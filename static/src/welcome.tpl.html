            Welcome to Unpaywall! When you see the
            <span class="tab-color green">green tab</span>
            beside a research article,
            click it to read the full text. Try this example:
        </p>
        <p class="eg">
            <a class="eg" target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7642/full/nature21360.html">
                <i class="fa fa-file-text-o"></i>
                Try it now
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <!--
            That article will cost you $32 to read on Nature.com...except now that
            you've got Unpaywall, it's free!
            -->

            You'll see our green tab on about half of articles
            (if we can't find fulltext, you'll see a
            <span class="tab-color gray">gray tab</span>

            ). Happy reading!

        </p>




        <p class="ps">
            PS for the Open Access nerds: the Unpaywall tab
            can change colors to indicate Green or Gold OA, too. Enable it in settings.
